GitHub Actions uses `gpui/runtime_shaders` on hosted macOS runners because the default GPUI Metal shader compilation path can fail when the Metal Toolchain is unavailable. CI Cargo targets use `--locked`, and `just check-platform-ci` verifies the accessibility-enabled library on Linux and Windows. `just clippy-strict` exists as the future hard gate, but CI currently uses `just clippy-ci` while the existing clippy debt is being paid down.

The `Justfile` is the canonical command source for local development and CI targets.

`just verify-capabilities-ci` validates the public API contract both without default features and with all package features enabled.
